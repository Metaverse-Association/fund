# The Open Metaverse Fund
The Metaverse Association is a traditional non-profit that funds open metaverse projects, and collaborates with web3 communities.

We believe the open metaverse represents one of the largest social changes that will happen in our lifetime. It is imperative that it is open, interoperable, and that the foundational principles target positive outcomes for society. 

There is a massive gap in our industry related to funding sources for Open Metaverse creators. Many open metaverse creators creating critical infrastructure lack a current path to revenue, and we don't want them to fizzle out. While we recognize that blockchain is an important component of the open metaverse, it is not all inclusive. In order to represent all of the critical needs of the Metaverse, funding access should be open and accessible by anyone. 

It is our belief that the open Metaverse is dependent on collaboration. We do not aspire to be a single institution, but actually work alongside the different stakeholders, because we all ultimately share the same vision. 

This is a new repo, meant to serve as a clean slate. Let's shape this association together, as a collective.
