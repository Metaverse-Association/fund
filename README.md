The Metaverse Association is a traditional non-profit foundation that funds open metaverse projects, and collaborates with web3 and web2 communities.

We believe the open metaverse represents one of the largest social changes that will happen in our lifetime. It is imperative that it is open, interoperable, and that the foundational principles target positive outcomes for society. 

There is a massive gap in our industry related to funding sources for Open Metaverse creators. Many open metaverse creators creating critical infrastructure lack a current path to revenue, and we don't want them to fizzle out. While we recognize that blockchain is an important component of the open metaverse, it is not all inclusive. In order to represent all of the critical needs of the Metaverse, funding access should be open and accessible by anyone. 

It is our belief that the open Metaverse is dependent on collaboration. We do not aspire to be a single institution, but actually work alongside the different stakeholders, because we all ultimately share the same vision. 

## Getting Involved 

This is a new repo, meant to serve as a clean slate. We rally around [milestones](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/fund/milestones), and [feedback discussions](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/feedback/discussions) Let's shape this association together, as a collective. We don't know what we don't know, and hope you'll help us make this group impactful and collaborative. 

## Getting Funded 

We are a new org, but we hope to serve the Metaverse quickly. We want to support people building for an Open and Interoperable Metaverse. To submit a funding request for review, please review: [Our Guidelines: What we are looking to fund]() for more information for how to qualify. More information about when, and how to come. 

## Raising Funds 

We opted to start as a traditional non-profit foundation. We believe that open metaverse creators deserve a chance to build out the critical infrastructure necessary for a more collaborative and open metaverse. We don't believe that should solely be driven by immediate profitability. We all benefit from interoperability and the open metaverse. That is why we intend to create avenues for traditional funds to get involved with supporting these projects. We intend to roll out new orgs and services in the future to help creators with a path to profitability scale as needed, and to help those without a path to profitability to succeed as intended. The metaverse is bigger than one org.
